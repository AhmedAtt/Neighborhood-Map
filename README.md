# Project Description
This is the final Project in the Udacity front-End developer Nanodegree . The aim of this project is to create a neighborhood map with my locations of interest.

#project Features
-Used Google Maps API to generate the map and the map is centered on Downtown of Cairo, Egypt.
-Initially added 5 locations however it's very easy to add new locations by simply adding a new location to the global locations array.
-The App allows for filtering the map by typing a query with a location name in the search box, using knockoutJs.
-For each location there is a location marker on the map that is automatically updated, also using knockoutJs.
-For each location marker there is an animation added that is shown on mouse over or if location is clicked
from the side navbar.
-The info window generated on each location marker is filled using Wikipedia API.

# How To Use
